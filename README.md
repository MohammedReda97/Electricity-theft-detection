# Electricity-theft-detection
Here we will implement supervised learning to detect abnormal users using CNN
# Introduction

Here we are tring to do anomaly detection for electricty consumption because manual detection is verry deficult and consume time and money 

# Data-set

This is a realistic electricity consumption dataset released by State Grid Corporation of China.
This dataset contains the electricity consumption data of 42,372 electricity customers within 1,035 days (from Jan. 1, 2014 to Oct. 31, 2016).
